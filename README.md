# noderunner

This is a wordpress plugin which uses a separate linking system. Honestly it's not that different from normal menus/links other than that it shows the nodes which link TO a given page as well as FROM it. That changes the way you traverse the space somehow and I still can't figure out if it's a good idea or just perception but I'm writing this wordpress version of it to find out.
